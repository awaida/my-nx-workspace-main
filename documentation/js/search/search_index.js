Now, let's get you up to speed!\nRun tasks\nTo run the dev server for your app, use:\nExample :npx nx serve mini-crmTo create a production bundle:\nExample :npx nx build mini-crmTo see all available targets to run for a project, run:\nExample :npx nx show project mini-crmThese targets are either inferred automatically or defined in the project.json or package.json files.\nMore about running tasks in the docs »\nAdd new projects\nWhile you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage Nx plugins and their code generation feature.\nUse the plugin's generator to create new projects.\nTo generate a new application, use:\nExample :npx nx g @nx/angular:app demoTo generate a new library, use:\nExample :npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylibYou can use npx nx list to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run npx nx list  to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, install Nx Console to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.\nLearn more about Nx plugins » | Browse the plugin registry »\nLearn more about Nx on CI\nInstall Nx Console\nNx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.\nInstall Nx Console »\nUseful links\nLearn more:\n\nLearn more about this workspace setup\nLearn about Nx on CI\nReleasing Packages with Nx release\nWhat are Nx plugins?\n\nAnd join the Nx community:\n\nDiscord\nFollow us on X or LinkedIn\nOur Youtube channel\nOur blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    17 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    6 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        0 \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n        \n            License : MIT\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"routes.html":{"url":"routes.html","title":"routes - routes","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Routes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"todo.html":{"url":"todo.html","title":"todo - todo","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/typealiases.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/typealiases.html","title":"miscellaneous-typealiases - typealiases","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Type aliases\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            CreateOrder   (libs/.../order.model.ts)\n                        \n                        \n                            UpdateOrder   (libs/.../order.model.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    libs/data-access/src/lib/models/order.model.ts\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    CreateOrder\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Payload for creating a new order.\nExcludes id (generated by json-server) and calculated totals\n(totalHt, totalTtc) which are computed on the frontend before sending.\n\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                            Omit\n\n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    UpdateOrder\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Payload for updating an existing order.\nExcludes calculated totals (totalHt, totalTtc) which are computed\non the frontend before sending.
